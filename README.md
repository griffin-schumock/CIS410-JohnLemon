Particle Effect (Griffin) - Added a rain particle system that activates when the player (JohnLemon)
                  enters the bathroom in the starting area with the ghost in the shower.
                  It is triggered on while the player is inside the room and will stop when
                  the player exits it via a trigger that is the size of the room.
